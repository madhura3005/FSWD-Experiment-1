This experiment was helpful to learn and practiced basics of HTML and CSS. I got introduced to using tags like nav, div, h4, p and learnt few advanced CSS design techniques like flexbox, grid, gradient background and uses internal, inline and external CSS and attribute definition in short-hand form, pop-up transitions on hover, applying new font to entire page. Thus, applied fundamental design principles to create a visually appealing and user-friendly frontend
interface using HTML and CSS.
